# Hey

there's not much here

## Part 1

here's a list

- apple
- kiwi

here's some code:
```jsx
console.log('hello world');
```

and here's a `custom` component

<button
  style={{
    border: '1px solid red',
    padding: 10,
  }}
  onClick={e => e.target.textContent = 'i was clicked'}
>Click me!</button>

Let's try something

import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

<Button variant="contained">Hello World</Button>
